    "In Python, integers are immutable objects, and each time you create a new integer object, memory is allocated for that object. For small integers (typically those in the range ``-5`` to ``256``), Python keeps a pool of pre-created integer objects and reuses them instead of creating a new object every time. This optimization is called small integer caching or integer interning.\n",

    "## **5. Why Python Uses Small Integer Caching**\n",
    "   \n",
    "The rationale behind small integer caching is that small numbers (e.g., -5 to 256) are used frequently in most programs. Instead of creating new objects each time an integer in this range is needed, Python reuses pre-existing objects, which has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory Efficiency: By reusing the same object for frequently used small integers, Python reduces memory consumption.\n",
    "* Performance Optimization: Caching avoids the overhead of repeatedly allocating and deallocating memory for common integers, improving execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This caching behavior is part of Python’s internal optimization mechanism and is not user-configurable. It helps Python perform efficiently without requiring developers to worry about the underlying memory management."

    "## **6. Effect on Immutability and Caching**\n",
    "Python integers are immutable objects, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. This immutability allows Python to safely cache small integers because you can't modify the value of an existing integer object. If integers were mutable, caching them would lead to issues where changing one variable could inadvertently affect another.\n"

For other immutable types like strings, Python also implements a similar interning mechanism, but the behavior is more complex and depends on the context (e.g., string literals vs. dynamically created strings).\n",

    "* **Small Integer Caching:** Python caches integers in the range ``-5`` to ``256`` for performance and memory efficiency. These integers are pre-allocated and shared across the program.\n",
    "* **Impact:** Variables referencing small integers in this range will share the same object in memory, while integers outside this range will create separate objects.\n",
